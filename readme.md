# Incident App

## Description
Incident App is a simple Apache Spark Java application that processes an incident CSV file and provides analytics such as the number of incidents per service and the top 2 years with the most incidents.

## Features
- Reads incident data from a CSV file (`incidents.csv`).
- Filters out the header and malformed lines.
- Counts the number of incidents grouped by service.
- Counts the number of incidents grouped by year.
- Displays the results in the console.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Apache Spark 3.x
- Maven (or your preferred build tool)

## Setup and Run

1. **Clone or download the project.**

2. **Place your `incidents.csv` file in the working directory.**  
   The CSV file should have at least 5 columns, where:
    - Column 4 (index 3) is the **service** name
    - Column 5 (index 4) is the **date** in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

3. **Build the project** (if using Maven):
```bash
mvn clean package
```
4. **Run the application** :
## Example Output:
```` bash
ðŸ“Œ Nombre d'incidents par service :
ServiceA : 120
ServiceB : 90
ServiceC : 45

ðŸ“Œ Les 2 annÃ©es avec le plus dâ€™incidents :
2023 : 150
2022 : 130
````
### Notes
The app runs locally using Sparkâ€™s local mode.

Make sure the input CSV file has valid formatting.

Lines starting with Id are ignored as headers.

Malformed lines with missing fields are skipped.
